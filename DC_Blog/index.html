        <div class="core-article"><p>Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Here's something that's fun. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.

            I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. We'll have a super time.
            
            We need dark in order to show light. Just let these leaves jump off the brush How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.
            
            Play with the angles. </p>
            <p>This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. This piece of canvas is your world. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.
            
               <blockquote> You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light.</blockquote>
                
                I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.

                <p>There we go. Poor old tree. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. All kinds of happy little splashes. And just raise cain.</p>
