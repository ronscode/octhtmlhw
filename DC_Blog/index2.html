                <p>Only eight colors that you need. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. What the devil. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Let that brush dance around there and play.</p>

<p>It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree.</p>

<p>The least little bit can do so much. And just raise cain. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.</p>

<p>Get tough with it, get strong. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. See there, told you that would be easy.</p>

<p>Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Work that paint. Very easy to work these to death. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.</p>

<p>We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.</p>

<p>We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just a little indication. You are only limited by your imagination. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.</p>
