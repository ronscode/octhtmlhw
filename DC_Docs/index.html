            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. This painting comes right out of your heart. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Here we're limited by the time we have. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>The light is your friend. Preserve it. Just make a decision and let it go. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?</p>
            <p>Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. It is a lot of fun. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.</p>
           <h2>Campus Info</h2>
            <p>We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds.</p>
